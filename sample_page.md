## Predicting Grain and Seed Oil Production in Ukraine

**Project description:** The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that is capable of predicting the amount of grain, specifically barley, wheat and corn, and sunflowerseed oil being produced in a calendar year, in Ukraine. The two sources of the data used in this project were United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and World Bank. Three linear models (Multi-variable Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) and three non-linear models (Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors Regression) were trained, tested and compared. Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) was used as a metric to compare the models. In the end, the model with the smallest RMSE on the test dataset is identified as the most suitable model for use as a tool to predict amount of grain and seed oil production in Ukraine.

### 1. Following 



```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
```python
if name=="Nay Zaw":
  print("He's awesome")
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
